## EconSim
Attemping to create a simulation of an economy similar to that of Victoria II. This will be done entirely in Python.

### Modus Operandi

#### Code hygiene
I will always attempt to fix the code before adding new features. This is the third time I am trying this project. The first time I was still a complete amateur and had never learnt OOP, the second one I had just started learning OOP and things went off the rails pretty quickly. I will refrain myself from adding more features until I review the code and make the changes I think are necessary in order to keep it maintainable and readable. That is not to say that I will always write code like this from the very beginning. I think it is OK to write sloppy code when adding new features, however these new feature additions should be followed by several code reviews and rewrites.

#### OOP
I have learnt OOP recently and I will attempt to use it and its design patterns to the best of my ability. I will not, however, use exclusively OOP just for the sake of using it. If I think a feature would be better implemented in procedural programming then I will use procedural programming. I am not a purist of any form.
