1. Turned the entire thing into a package. Removed all relative imports. Added a way to run all tests together quickly.

2. Turned the `size` of a `Pop` object into a property in order to prevent very small values.

3. Added data gathering and data visualization.

4. Added a loop that simulates what the simulation can currently already do.

5. Added the `employ` method to the `Extractor` class, allowing it to employ passed `Pop`s.
