1. Laying off workers

(P1 + x) / (Ps + P1 + x) = S

Where P1 is the relevante occupation, 
Ps is the sum of all other occupations, 
x is the amount of those who will be laid off, 
S is the desired share,
and T is the total amount of workers or P1 + Ps.

P1 + x = S(Ps + P1 + x)
P1 + x = SPs + SP1 + Sx
x + Sx = SPs + Sp1 - P1
x(1 + S) = S(Ps + P1) - P1
x = (ST - P1) / (1 + S)
